Introduction
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets. In this project, we apply K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset, aiming to group similar iris flowers based on their features.

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-iris.git
cd kmeans-iris
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook KMeans_Clustering_Iris.ipynb
# or
python KMeans_Clustering_Iris.py
Follow the instructions and explore the code to understand the K-Means clustering implementation on the Iris dataset.
